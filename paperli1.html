</h3> The writer wishes it to be clearly understood that the descriptions provided in the
following pages, I lays no claim to infallibility. I have written as I have understood, And
I have communicated my own understanding of the existing knowledge, which could be
improved with different sets of skills and experiences in the journey - however
ill-perceived and ill-conceived - to others working along the same path, I claims
nothing more. It is just my honest attempt trying to propose a viable path for
a blind enthusiast and tinkerers to be able to work in the glorious world of
electronics.

<!-- l. 126 --><p class='noindent'>Engineering is all about contriving solutions to problems in a creative way. According to
my American Heritage Dictionary, the word "engineering" and "ingenious" have a
common Latin root, "ingenium," which means talent or skill. In medieval Latin,
"ingeniare" was to contrive. The question arises in every conscious engineer’s mind is as
follows: <br class='newline' />Who are the people we serve? How can we properly assess their needs? Given
identifiable needs, what is good engineering? How can we expedite the "trial and error"
process of optimizing the solutions? Can one engineering staff adequately take on this
responsibility?

<!-- l. 134 --><p class='indent'>   India with the large population of low vision and blind persons, there is a huge
shortage for learning skills and employment opportunities. How could we ensure that
differently-abled population gets equal opportunities in all aspects? How do we make
sure that they will get appropriate education? is there any educational program in STEM
specifically designed for blind and low vision? Particularly what about electronics?
Blind Electronics? Is it possible?
</p><!-- l. 136 --><p class='indent'>   The blind and visually impaired community is very much the loser for not
sharing individual rehabilitation engineering solutions amongst themselves.
They always considered as a consumer or just a user of assistive technology,
whether it’s electronics, softwares / apps etc. Nobody really cares to make them
independent. But we are going to change this scenario by making them equally
participating in the resource development process and ultimately making them a
self-reliant.
</p><!-- l. 138 --><p class='indent'>   "We cannot blame society’s lack of understanding for our ignorance; we must blame
our careless isolation which we have allowed to happen. We have isolated ourselves by
                                                                          

                                                                          
not sharing our experiences ad by not working toward a collective understanding and
identity."
